# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.

## Getting Started

### Installing Python
Visit [python.org](https://python.org) to download and install Python 3.x for your operating system.

### Your First Python Program
Create a file called `hello.py` and add the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run it from the terminal:
```bash
python hello.py
```

## Basic Syntax

### Comments
```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

### Printing Output
```python
print("Welcome to Python!")
print("Python", "is", "awesome")
print(42)
```

### Basic Input
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

## Python Indentation
Unlike many languages that use braces, Python uses indentation to define code blocks:

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
    print("This is also indented")
print("This is not indented")
```

## Practice Exercise
1. Write a program that prints your name
2. Write a program that asks for a user's age and prints it back
3. Create a program with at least 3 different print statements
